My main interest is to be able to use the Movidius compute stick (2) on the ARM platform. I was hoping that 
I could compile the libraries and drivers necessary just for that accelerator. I tried to turn off the CPU and 
GPU portions of the build with cmake options but it didn't seem to work. Does the Movidius NCS software still 
require SIMD instructions?
From the build instructions:
To switch on/off the CPU and GPU plugins, use cmake options -DENABLE_MKL_DNN=ON/OFF and -DENABLE_CLDNN=ON/OFF.
